My name is Gahee (Olivia) Oh, a medical doctor and an MPH student in Quantitative Methods at Harvard University. Currently, I am studying the long-term effect of multicomponent frailty intervention on socioeconomically vulnerable older adults, under the supervision of Professor Dae Kim at Harvard Medical School. I worked as a general practitioner in South Korea for 3+ years in diverse settings including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care.
